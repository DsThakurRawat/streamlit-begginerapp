### üîß Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run CampusConnect on your local machine.

#### **Prerequisites**

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
* Node.js (for Tailwind CLI, if you're modifying CSS).

#### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/campusconnect.git](https://github.com/your-username/campusconnect.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd campusconnect
    ```
3.  **Configure Supabase Credentials:**
    * Open your main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) or the primary JavaScript file where Supabase is initialized.
    * Locate the Supabase client creation code and replace the placeholders with your actual Supabase Project URL and Anon Key.
    ```javascript
    const SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL";
    const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";
    const supabase = window.supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
    ```
    > **Security Note:** For production deployments, it is highly recommended to use environment variables or a server-side approach to manage your Supabase keys, rather than embedding them directly in client-side code, especially the service role key.

4.  **Supabase Database Schema:**
    * Create a new project in your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/).
    * Go to the **SQL Editor** and execute the following SQL to set up your `posts` table (and any other tables your project uses, like `profiles`, `comments`, etc.):
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE posts (
      id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
      username TEXT NOT NULL,
      user_email TEXT, -- Can be used for avatars or linking to profiles
      content TEXT NOT NULL,
      image_url TEXT, -- Optional: for posts with images
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
      likes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
      -- Add more fields as needed, e.g., 'user_id' for RLS
    );

    -- Example for enabling Row Level Security (RLS) and policies
    ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON posts
      FOR SELECT USING (true);

    CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert posts" ON posts
      FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
    ```
    * **Crucial:** Configure your **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies carefully. The example above allows anyone to read posts and authenticated users to insert. Adjust these policies based on your application's security requirements.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
    * For a development environment with live reloading, consider using a tool like [VS Code's Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
