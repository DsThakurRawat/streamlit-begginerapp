## üîß Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### **Prerequisites**
You will need a code editor (like VS Code) and a modern web browser.

#### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/campusconnect.git](https://github.com/your-username/campusconnect.git)
    cd campusconnect
    ```

2.  **Configure Supabase Credentials**
    * Navigate to the file containing your JavaScript logic.
    * Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase Project URL and Anon Key.
    ```javascript
    const SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL";
    const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";
    const supabase = window.supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
    ```
    > **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** Never commit your secret keys to a public repository. For a production app, use environment variables.

3.  **Set Up the Supabase Database Schema**
    * Create a new project in your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/).
    * Go to the **SQL Editor** and run the following queries to create the necessary tables.
    ```sql
    -- Profiles Table (stores public user data)
    CREATE TABLE profiles (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      full_name TEXT,
      avatar_url TEXT,
      status TEXT, -- e.g., 'Student', 'Alumnus'
      graduation_year INT,
      title TEXT,
      about TEXT
    );

    -- Posts Table
    CREATE TABLE posts (
      id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
      user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      content TEXT NOT NULL,
      image_url TEXT,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
    );

    -- Crushes Table (for the Cupid feature)
    CREATE TABLE crushes (
      id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
      submitter_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      crush_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
      UNIQUE(submitter_id, crush_id) -- Prevents duplicate submissions
    );

    -- Enable Row Level Security (CRUCIAL for security)
    ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE crushes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Create RLS Policies (examples)
    CREATE POLICY "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile." ON profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
    CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile." ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);
    ```
    *You will need to create similar, appropriate RLS policies for `posts`, `messages`, and `crushes` based on your application's logic.*

4.  **Run the Application**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.
    * For the best development experience, use an extension like **Live Server** in VS Code.
